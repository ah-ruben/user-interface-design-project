Project Scenario

You were recently hired as a UI/UX Designer for Synesthor, an IT services company that offers on-site consultation for small businesses without an IT department. Synesthor recently contracted with Paradigm Pet Professionals, a company that specializes in providing virtual consultations to pet owners with state-of-the-art, evidence-based health and well-being information. Its website was designed by a part-time intern 10 years ago. Most people who visit the website are prospective and new pet owners located in the United States who seek information about basic pet care and are interested in speaking with a consultant. Paradigm Pet Professionals contracted with Synesthorâ€™s UI/UX department to develop a responsive website to meet the needs of its company and the needs of users.



Your first objective is to evaluate the existing website and user design specifications provided by Paradigm Pet Professionals (see Web Links and Supporting Documents sections). You will also develop a sitemap and wireframe for the redeveloped website.



Your second objective is to create an interactive desktop prototype of the redeveloped website according to the design specifications provided by Paradigm Pet Professionals.
